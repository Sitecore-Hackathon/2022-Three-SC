# Sitecore Hackathon 2022  

## Team name
⟹ Three.SC

## Category
⟹ Extend the Sitecore Command Line interface (CLI) plugin

## Description
⟹ This module extends the Sitecore CLI plugin, adding a new plugin named Three.SC.CLI

 **This plugin comes with two commands**
 1. Listing all locked Sitecore items in Sitcore tree.
 2. Unlocking all Sitecore items at once or by passing thier item IDs in the CLI.

**The problem we solve:**
 - Unlocking a single Sitecore item is very easy to perform, however when developers want to unlock all the Sitecore items at once, it will take time to go through each item or prepare different scripts to loop the content tree and unlock all items.

 - Getting a list of all locked item in Sitecore content tree can be challenging and require us to write a script.

 **The solution:**
 You can unlock all Sitecore items in the content tree using one line command with the Three.SC.CLI plugin that we built in the Hackathon 2022.  

     dotnet sitecore items unlock

 You can list all the locked items in Sitecore tree with a single command as well. 

     dotnet sitecore items listlocked
